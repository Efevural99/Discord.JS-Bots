# Notice

There are things about this repo you may not like

1. I use backticks, everywhere.
2. I use my own "framework"
3. Probbably more

I use backticks everywhere because it doesn't cause any loss in performance, I don't have to escape " or ' and I can use template literals whenever I want.

I use my own "framework" that allows me to share commands between bots that I would otherwise have to duplicate files for, and then update all copies when I make a change, this way it reduces duplicate code.
